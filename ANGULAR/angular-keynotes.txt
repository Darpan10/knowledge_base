Angular key NOTES :

attribute vs properties binding in angular :

- Attributes define the initial state of an element in the HTML markup.

- Properties represent the current state or behavior of an element in the DOM after it has been rendered.

- Changes to attributes don't automatically reflect in properties, but changes to properties are reflected in the DOM and might affect behavior or appearance.
